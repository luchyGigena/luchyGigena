Hi there! I'm Lu
I'm a Full Stack developer with a strong orientation to Front-End. Currently training myself in Henry's intensive Bootcamp.

I am passionate about learning and I have found something I love doing because I never settled. Even though there's still much for me to learn in this huge sea of knowledge and new technologies, that drives me to keep me on my toes still learning and reinventing myself every step of the way.

MY STACK
. Javascript
. ReactJs
. Redux
. PostgreSQL
. Sequelize
. NodeJs
. Express
. HTML5
. CSS3
. SCRUM methodologies
. Bootstrap
. Git | Github

I've worked as an administrative assistant for five years, that's why I'm exceptionally well-organized, problem-solving, able to effectively multi-task, prioritize and take initiative.
I'd like to be part of a team where I can keep growing, learning, and developing in this beautiful career I chose.

Contact me! Tell me about your proposal to:
gigenalucian@gmail.com or through LinkedIn direct message.
